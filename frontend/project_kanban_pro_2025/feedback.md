Please download the following font files and place them into the newly created `public/fonts` directory:

1.  **Virgil.woff2:** For the "Excalidraw (Hand)" style.
2.  **CascadiaCode.woff2:** For the "Código (Cascadia)" style.

You can typically find these fonts on their respective official pages or reliable font repositories. For example, Cascadia Code is available from Microsoft's GitHub, and Virgil font variations can often be found on font hosting sites or associated with Excalidraw's resources.

Once these files are in place, the customizable markdown editor in your `ItemEditor` modal should correctly display and persist your chosen font styles.
